    <h1>My girlfriend Brooke is the best thing to ever happen to me!</H1>
<hr>
    <p>
        My girlfriend's name is Brooke! 
        She's 5'5 (even tho i'm pretty sure she's 5'4) 
        and she loves me so much! But she doesn't know 
        that <b><ins>I love her more</ins></b> and am so so excited to spend 
        the rest of my life with her! 
        (once I figure out her ring size of course)
        But honestly I could not imagine my life right now without her, she has 
        truly made my life amazing in so many ways and I made this to show my appreciation for her!
    </p>

    <p>
        I spend pretty much every second of every day thinking about her and
        how much I love her, it's unmeasurable. 
        I have never been treated better by anyone ever and it makes me so happy 
        every second i get to talk to or even look at her it makes my day so much better
        and I hope that she feels the same about me, I love you so much Brooke
    </p>
